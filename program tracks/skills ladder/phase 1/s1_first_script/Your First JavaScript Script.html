 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Where to Put Your Script</div><div class="headingText">
            
      <p>While the HTML probably looks familiar to you, we also introduced a new element—the 
          <b>&lt;script&gt;</b> element. This element tells the browser to expect JavaScript. In this case, we placed the &lt;script&gt; 
          element in the <i>head</i> of our HTML document. That's generally a good place for a short script that will be used only by 
          the page on which it's located.</p>
            
      <p>You can also place the script in the <i>body</i> of your HTML if you like. Modify your code as shown:</p>
                
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt; My First JavaScript &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;

  <del>&lt;script&gt;
    var age = 10;
    var ageInDogYears = age * 7;
    alert("Age in dog years: " + ageInDogYears);
  &lt;/script&gt;
</del>
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
<ins>
  &lt;script&gt;
    var age = 10;
    var ageInDogYears = age * 7;
    alert("Age in dog years: " + ageInDogYears);
  &lt;/script&gt;
</ins>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div></div>
                
      <p><img src="Your%20First%20JavaScript%20Script_files/preview.png"> Save and preview it.</p>
            
      <p>The browser runs your JavaScript code as soon as it sees it, 
while it's parsing your HTML document. So, if you place your 
          JavaScript in the &lt;head&gt; of your document, it will run 
earlier than if you place it in the &lt;body&gt;.  
          In JavaScript, like in HTML, the browser evaluates and runs 
your code top-down, so JavaScript statements at the top run before 
          JavaScript statements at the bottom.</p>
            
      <p>As you'll see a bit later, ordering is important!</p>
        
  </div>
  <a name="h_03"></a><div class="heading">Linking to an External Script</div><div class="headingText">
            
      <p>If you're going to use your JavaScript in multiple HTML files, 
or you just want to keep your JavaScript and HTML separate, you 
          can link to a JavaScript file. It's similar to how you link to
 CSS files, except that instead of using the &lt;link&gt; 
          tag, you use the &lt;script&gt; tag. First, copy and paste all
 the JavaScript (between the &lt;script&gt; tags) from dogyears.html 
into a new file
          in your <b>/javascript1</b> folder; name that file <b>dogyears.js</b>. Then, remove that JavaScript from dogyears.html and 
          change the &lt;script&gt; element so that it links to the new file. Modify your code as shown:</p>
            
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt; My First JavaScript &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  <ins>
  &lt;script src="dogyears.js"&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
  </ins>
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  <del>&lt;script&gt;
    var age = 10;
    var ageInDogYears = age * 7;
    alert("Age in dog years: " + ageInDogYears);
  &lt;/script&gt;
</del>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div></div>
            
      <p>We moved the &lt;script&gt; element back to the &lt;head&gt; of the document. Even though we 
          don't have any JavaScript between the opening and closing script tags, we still include both. This is important!  
          If you don't include both the opening and closing script tags, you may get weird behavior in your browser.</p>
            
      <p>Click <img src="Your%20First%20JavaScript%20Script_files/preview.png"> on dogyears.html. You should see the same dialog as before.</p>
            
      <p>Linking to an external JavaScript file from the &lt;head&gt; of
 the document is the most common way to include JavaScript 
          in a web page. If you "view source" code of web pages, you'll 
usually see the JavaScript included like 
          that.  We'll be using the same method frequently, as well as 
placing our JavaScript in the &lt;head&gt; element, throughout the rest 
of 
          the course.</p>
            
      <p>Try it right now! Go to the <a href="http://www.oreillyschool.com/" target="_blank">O'Reilly School website</a> and view the 
          page source. You'll see a combination of links to JavaScript and JavaScript embedded in the document itself.</p>
        
  </div>
  <a name="h_04"></a><div class="heading">The &lt;script&gt; Element</div><div class="headingText">
            
      <p>The &lt;script&gt; element is pretty straightforward and you 
now know everything you need to know about &lt;script&gt; for this 
course.  
          But, when you check out how other pages link to JavaScript 
files, you might notice that some links include a <b>type</b> attribute.</p>
            
      <p>The <b>type</b> attribute used to be required because browsers 
used to support different scripting languages; for instance, for 
          a long time, IE supported JScript, while Netcape supported 
JavaScript. Now that browsers have standardized a bit more, 
          JavaScript is the default scripting language for all the major
 browsers, so the type attribute is optional.  
          Still, if you'd like to use it (maybe you know that some of 
your users still use old browsers), you can—it's still 
          supported! Edit <b>dogyears.html</b> as shown:</p>
            
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;

  &lt;title&gt; My First JavaScript &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;script src="dogyears.js" <ins>type="text/javascript"</ins>&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;

  <a name="h_05"></a><div class="heading">Create and Calling a Function</div><div class="headingText">
            
      <p>When you're writing JavaScript, most of the time you'll put your code in <i>functions</i>. You'll also use many of the built-in 
          functions available in JavaScript. We'll cover functions in greater detail later in the course, for now, think of a 
          function as a way to package a chunk of code so that it's more convenient to access and reuse later.</p>
            
      <p>Just to get warmed up using functions, let's change the script you've already written in <b>dogyears.js</b>, and put 
          that code inside a function. Modify the code as shown:</p>
            
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>function dogYears() {</ins>
    var age = 10;
    var ageInDogYears = age * 7;
    alert("Age in dog years: " + ageInDogYears);
<ins>}</ins>
</pre></div></div>
      
      <p>We've put all the code that was in your file into a function named <b>dogYears</b>. The <b>function</b> keyword indicates that we're 
          defining a function named <b>dogYears</b>. All the code in the function goes between an opening and closing brackets <b>{}</b>. 
          By convention, we indent the code inside the function, so it's easier 
          to see that the code is part of the function and not the code around it, and also to keep the brackets matching.</p>
            
      <p>Save your <b>dogyears.js</b> file, and click <img src="Your%20First%20JavaScript%20Script_files/preview.png"> on <b>dogyears.html</b> to reload the page. 
          Did you see the alert?</p>
            
      <p>No! You did <i>not</i> see the alert because now all the JavaScript code is in a function, and the only way to get the function's 
          code to run is to <i>call</i> it. To do that, add one more line of code to <b>dogyears.js</b>. Modify your code as shown:</p>
            
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>function dogYears() {
    var age = 10;
    var ageInDogYears = age * 7;
    alert("Age in dog years: " + ageInDogYears);
}
<ins>dogYears();</ins>
</pre></div></div>
            
      <p>Save your JavaScript file, and <img src="Your%20First%20JavaScript%20Script_files/preview.png"> on dogyears.html again. Do you see the alert now?</p>
            
      <p>Now that you've packaged the code into a function, it'll be convenient to use that code whenever you want—behold the power of 
          functions! You could type <b>dogYears();</b> as many times as you want in your JavaScript file and you'd get the 
          equivalent number of alerts. You can reuse the code in the dogYears() function without having to type it repeatedly.</p>
            
      <p>Try adding a few more calls to the dogYears() function as shown:</p>
            
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>function dogYears() {
    var age = 10;
    var ageInDogYears = age * 7;
    alert("Age in dog years: " + ageInDogYears);
}
dogYears();
<ins>dogYears();</ins>
<ins>dogYears();</ins>
<ins>dogYears();</ins>
</pre></div></div>
        
       
      <p><img src="Your%20First%20JavaScript%20Script_files/preview.png"> dogyears.html again How many alerts do you see now? It might seem like overkill to get that 
          many alerts, but you can see how nice it is to have that code packaged up into a function.</p>
        
  </div>
  <a name="h_06"></a><div class="heading">Built-In Functions vs. Creating Your Own Functions</div><div class="headingText">
  
      <p>Most of what you do in JavaScript is writing and using functions. For example, <b>alert</b>
 is a built-in function that takes a 
          string (a series of characters between quotation marks) and 
displays that string in a dialog box. Let's try another built-in 
          function, <b>prompt</b>. Type this code into your editor as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>function dogYears() {
    <del>var age = 10;</del>
    <ins>var age = prompt("Enter your dog's age: " );</ins>
    var ageInDogYears = age * 7;
    alert("Age in dog years: " + ageInDogYears);
}
dogYears();
<del>dogYears();</del>
<del>dogYears();</del>
<del>dogYears();</del>
</pre></div></div>
            
      <table class="noteBox pBox "><tbody><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">If you are using IE, you may need to change a browser setting for this script to work properly. Select 
          <b>Tools | Internet Options | Security</b> and check that "Allow websites to prompt for information using scripted windows" is 
          enabled.</td></tr></tbody></table>
            
      <p><img src="Your%20First%20JavaScript%20Script_files/preview.png"> dogyears.html to see how <b>prompt</b>
 works. It prompts you to enter your dog's age. 
          So instead of just setting the dog's age to 10 every time we 
call the function dogYears, we ask the user to enter their dog's 
          age, storing that value in a variable named age, and then 
displaying that age multiplied by 7.</p>
            
      <p>Don't worry about all the details of variables and functions 
yet; we're just getting your feet wet with JavaScript and getting a 
          basic script working for now. We'll come back to all these 
details shortly, I promise!</p>
        
  </div>
  <a name="h_07"></a><div class="heading">Using Other People's Scripts</div><div class="headingText">
            
      <p>Just about every web page on the internet uses JavaScript. If you find a page that contains JavaScript you like, it may be 
          convenient to copy and paste the JavaScript from the web page into yours and use it.
            
      That's absolutely fine when you're learning JavaScript and you want to try things out. But it's definitely <i>not</i> fine for 
          you to use other people's scripts in a live web page without getting their permission first!</p>
            
      <p>If you find a script you like, and you want to use it, make 
sure you ask permission from the person upon whose web page you found 
it. 
          Typically, people are open to sharing their scripts, as long 
as you give them attribution for them. Using scripts 
          without permission is copyright infringement, so stay on the 
          safe (and honorable) side, and ask permission before you use 
other people's scripts.</p>
        
 </div>
 <a name="h_08"></a><div class="heading">Script Libraries</div><div class="headingText">
            
      <p>There are lots of places you can get <i>script libraries</i> now as well. These are scripts that are designed to be downloaded, or 
          linked to, and used by other people. One of the most popular script libraries on the internet is <b>jQuery</b>,
 a library 
          designed to make many common tasks you do with JavaScript (to 
interact with a web page, or create UI effects, for instance) 
          easier. You can use this library without asking anyone's 
permission, as long as you leave all the information in the JavaScript 
          files you download intact so others know you're using the 
jQuery library.</p>
            
      
     <p>Perform a <i>view source</i> on a few of your favorite web pages and see if you can find the JavaScript. You might find that some of them 
          link to well-known libraries, like jQuery, or have their own code in the page or linked to from the page, or both!</p>
